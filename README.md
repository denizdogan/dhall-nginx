## Content

Every directory contains a `Spec` file which is the specification for the folder `name`, i.e. `Location/Spec` is the specification for the `location` directive.

Most directories contain a `Spec.empty` and `Spec.example` file, where `.empty` populates the record with default values and `.example` provides a record with example values.
